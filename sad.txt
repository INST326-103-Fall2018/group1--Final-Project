Once you choose hope, anything is possibleOnly through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achievedA positive attitude gives you power over your circumstances instead of your circumstances having power over you.Keep yourself busy if you want to avoid depression. For me, inactivity is the enemyMaybe you have to know the darkness before you can appreciate the light.There are far, far better things ahead than anything we leave behindRing the bells that still can ring. Forget your perfect offering. There is a crack, a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in.IÕm stronger because I had to be, IÕm smarter because of my mistakes, happier because of the sadness IÕve known, and now wiser because I learnedOnly trust someone who can see these three things in you: The sorrow behind your smile, the love behind your anger, and the reason behind your silence.      Sad
